<h1>Pageswipe</h1>
<h2>Jquery UI widget</h2>

The pages are as wide as the viewport and are underneath next to eachother.
Swipe horizontally through pages.
One navigation with all the pages, updating when sliding.
Load pages asynchronous.

Todo:
- call widget lik this: $('wrapper').swipeable({ options });
- make seperate plugin and add listener to the swipe
- use var instead of options
- modernizr checks
- navigate directly to project by hash in url
- load pages in the placeholders
- deal with short pages
